          <p>The New Media Artspace is proud to present <i>Sarada Rauch: If All Things Were Equal, You&rsquo;d  Only Be the Sequel</i>, a solo exhibition of eight single-channel moving image works by the New  York-based artist. Rauch&rsquo;s projects are frequently set at intimate scales of personal engagement &mdash;a tabletop, a tablet, a domestic tableau, a neighborhood. At a time when the world&rsquo;s problems  often seem inconceivably large, Rauch scales everything down into a framework where  intervention becomes possible. With deceptively modest means, they craftily manipulate things  in the troubled present to arrive at impoverished but hopeful images of how the world might be  otherwise. Even while Rauch dares to imagine &ldquo;If All Things Were Equal,&rdquo; their works  unflinchingly acknowledge a present reality in which that is far from being the case. <br><br>  A homespun aesthetic runs throughout Rauch&rsquo;s work. As an interdisciplinary artist, Rauch has a  practice that seems to swallow whole whatever media lie in their path. They employ animation,  video, performance, photography, poetry, music, and sculpture, overflowing these categories  freely. Several of the video works in <i>If All Things Were Equal</i> derive from an art album, <i>In the Realm of a Dying Star</i>: Side A, featuring Rauch&rsquo;s own music. Like their animation style, the  music makes self-aware reference to Rauch as a one-person band, remixing themself and filling  every role. Endearingly underproduced, the songs at first seem to deliver anti-capitalist un- slickness, flying in the face of mass-production norms. This could be interpreted as an anarchist  commitment to self-sufficiency, but while the work operates this way, it is more complex, too.  Rauch is aware that even their restrained production values nevertheless rely on technologies that are themselves the spoils of war and products of human suffering. They voice this critique in  <i>Second Law of Thermodynamics</i>, which pans through a domestic interior across a countertop  littered with everyday items that in Rauch&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;hold a history of exploitation [... including]  merchandise made on the backs of human rights abuses, oil and gas, and the militarization of the  police.&rdquo;1 Even Rauch&rsquo;s homemade works unfurl tentacles outward into networks of allyship and  complicity. <br><br>  Perhaps for this reason, Rauch constantly reminds their audience that they participate in every  element seen or heard in their work. Rauch leans heavily on &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; of the eye, literally  reframing what we see. Yet, Rauch is continually showing their hand, exposing their methods  and undoing their magic, while nevertheless keeping us captivated. In the title of one work,  Rauch baldly admits <i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve Got a Hand in It.&rdquo;</i> They imply that they&mdash;and by extension we&mdash;are  culpable for suffering on the other side of the world, as distant as it may seem from their  comfortable life. At the same time, this phrase also means that their hand is literally in their  work, touching their images, and pointing to themself as creator in their role as an artist. <br><br> What is the role of an artist? For Rauch, it seems to be in experimentation, in messing around  sometimes playfully but with serious intent. It is also in dogged introspection, speaking hard  truths to themself, and&mdash;crucially&mdash;with this information crafting political consciousness.  Against the odds, the handmade imagery and self-styled soundtracks in Rauch&rsquo;s works, coupled  with their coyly outspoken political awakening, leads to enfranchisement, and their  preoccupation with apocalyptic end times retains optimistic opportunity. The exploit at the heart  of Rauch&rsquo;s practice seems to be this lesson: Political identity becomes a matter of craft, of self- fashioning, and of pragmatic agentic intervention. Politics is in the craft of making do and  making better by whatever means are available at hand. If this is so, an artist&rsquo;s role is to take  things as they are quite at hand, making them available to manual manipulations, and making the present (even the doomed present) malleable. <br><br>  Rauch shows their hand again and again, with examples of their manipulative technique (or anti- technique) that undercut the investment in illusion that undergirds media consumption habits.  The opposite of keeping one&rsquo;s cards close to one&rsquo;s chest, showing your hand gives away for free  the value media purport to hold (over us). For instance, Rauch&rsquo;s life-size index finger interrupts  the collage-based animation Middles. Pointing to the center of the work, the finger disrupts its  illusion, and points out a lesson in perspective that applies equally to philosophy, physics, and  optics. Meanwhile, in the video work Gravity, a jokey premise&mdash;children&rsquo;s make-believe and  obvious greenscreen&mdash;manages to generate real joy and potential by liberating kids to fly away  and soar above it all. The joy is as real as the manipulation is obvious; the children&rsquo;s knowing  participation in faking it results in genuine smiles. In both cases, Rauch leverages a medium at  the precise point where it is conventionally most manipulative&mdash;that is, where it convinces us to  buy in to its seamlessness. Rauch has discovered that that is also exactly where the medium is  most available to manipulation. The apparent seamless of images is really a seam that can be  opened onto another world. <br><br> In the first work in the exhibition, Topple, the political relevance of Rauch&rsquo;s anti-technique is at  the fore. Rauch recreates monuments of patriarchal and racist oppressors at miniature scale and  shoots them against diorama-like backgrounds of the public spaces where they were installed.  Then, with their full-scale hand and a bit of string, they topple them one by one. Showing their  hand, they seem to say, &ldquo;It can be as easy as that.&rdquo; </p>
